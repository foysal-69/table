	<h1>Most Beautiful Types of Sunflowers</h1>
	<p class="defination">Summer is finally here and nothing says summer quite like the sunflower! With petals to match the sun’s glowing rays, it is no wonder these flowers are one of the most popular. Sunflowers make up the genus Helianthus which contains almost 70 different species. The meaning of sunflower is rooted in it’s genus Helianthus- helios meaning sun and anthos meaning flower.

Grown year round, sunflowers have large flower faces and bright petals. Relatively easy to cultivate, sunflowers love direct sunlight and flourish best in hot summer months. Because of their large roots and long stems, sunflowers are heavy feeders and grow best in nutrient-rich soil. The most common sunflower is that of the species Annuus and is known for its ordinary height and yellow color.   </p>
